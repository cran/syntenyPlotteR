Description: Draw syntenic relationships between genome assemblies.
    There are 3 functions which take a tab delimited file containing alignment data for 
    syntenic blocks between genomes to produce either a linear alignment plot, 
    an evolution highway style plot, or a painted ideogram representing syntenic relationships.
    There is also a function to convert alignment data in the DESCHRAMBLER/inferCAR format
    to the required data structure.
